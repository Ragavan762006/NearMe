The aim of this initiative is to establish at least one e-Sevai centre in every village and a ward in Tamil Nadu. The objective is to increase the number of centres across the state by taking e-services to the remotest corners of Tamil Nadu while simultaneously making this a viable entrepreneurship opportunity for citizens.
